                    <p class="abstract_paper">Internet of Things (IoT) devices often come with batteries of limited
                        capacity that are not easily replaceable or rechargeable, and that constrain significantly the
                        sensing, computing, and communication tasks that they can perform. The Simultaneous Wireless
                        Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) paradigm addresses this issue by delivering power
                        wirelessly to energy-harvesting IoT devices with the same signal used for information transfer.
                        For their peculiarity, these networks require specific energy-efficient planning and management
                        approaches. However, to date, it is not clear what are the most effective strategies for
                        managing a SWIPT network for energy efficiency. In this paper, we address this issue by
                        developing an analytical model based on stochastic geometry, accounting for the statistics of
                        user-perceived performance and base station scheduling. We formulate an optimization problem for
                        deriving the energy optimal configuration as a function of the main system parameters, and we
                        propose a genetic algorithm approach to solve it. Our results enable a first-order evaluation of
                        the most effective strategies for energy-efficient provisioning of power and communications in a
                        SWIPT network. We show that the service capacity brought about by users brings energy-efficient
                        dynamic network provisioning strategies that radically differ from those of networks with no
                        wireless power transfer.</p>

                        Cybersecurity: A Comparative Analysis of ISO/SAE 21434-Compliant Automatic Collision
                        Notification (ACN) Systems</a></h3>
                    <h6> Vehicles 2023</h6>
                    <p class="abstract_paper">The increasing usage of autonomous and automatic systems within the
                        automotive industry is steering us towards a more interconnected world. This enhanced
                        interconnectivity fosters a more streamlined driving experience, reduces costs, and provides
                        timely driver assistance. The electric/electronic (EE) architectures of modern vehicles are
                        inherently complex due to the multitude of components they encompass. Contemporary architectures
                        reveal that these components converge at an electronic control unit (ECU) called the central
                        gateway, which could potentially represent a single point of failure. While this central unit is
                        typically adequately safeguarded, the same cannot be said for the connected components, which
                        often remain vulnerable to cyber threats. The ISO/SAE 21434 standard paved the way for
                        automotive cybersecurity and could be used in parallel with other standards such as ISO 26262
                        and ISO PAS 21488. Automatic collision notification (ACN) is one of the most typical systems in
                        a vehicle, and limited effort has been dedicated to identifying the most suitable architecture
                        for this feature. This paper addresses the existing security and privacy gap of this feature by
                        conducting a comparative analysis of security threats in two distinct ACN architectures.
                        Notably, despite ACN architectures exhibiting inherent similarities, the primary distinction
                        between the two architectures lies in their strategies for crash estimation and detection,
                        followed by subsequent communication with emergency response teams. A rigorous security
                        assessment was conducted using the ISO/SAE 21434 standard, employing the TARA and STRIDE
                        methodologies through the Ansys medini analyze software. This analysis identified an average of
                        310 threats per architecture, including a significant number of high-level threats (11.8% and
                        15%, respectively), highlighting the importance of a comprehensive evaluation.</p>

                    <p class="abstract_paper">As data collection systems become more complex and pervasive, ensuring
                        transparency and accountability in the acquisition and use of personal data becomes increasingly
                        critical. This work investigates the use of knowledge graphs as a solution to this problem,
                        emphasizing their capacity to represent and enforce privacy laws in a decentralized setting.
                        Knowledge graphs provide full privacy management and can be applied also to decentralized
                        systems by providing a consistent representation of data and privacy policies. We specifically
                        discuss how knowledge graphs can be used to track consent management and data retention
                        policies; we also present a case study of our framework in action, demonstrating how it can be
                        used to ensure transparency in an increasingly popular decentralized data collection system. The
                        implementation of such a framework in a decentralized context shows that the use of knowledge
                        graphs can provide a transparent and accountable view of the data collection process, improving
                        trust and confidence in the system among both data subjects and regulators.</p>

                    <p class="abstract_paper">Web authentication is primarily based on password usage, representing the
                        weakest link in the entire security chain. The number of services offered over the web is
                        continuously increasing, and with them also the number of required passwords that users need to
                        create and securely store. Despite various standards for password-less or multi-factor
                        authentication, another issue is that most web authentication means use an identity provider (or
                        a federation of providers) advocated to create, manage and check digital identity claims; able
                        to profile user habits related to web navigation and violate rights in terms of privacy.
                        Recently, we are witnessing a radical change of perspective, where identity checks and
                        enforcement are moved away from the providers and more focused on users. Within such
                        user-centric approaches, Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) has faced progressive popularity, and
                        some authentication mechanisms based on SSI have been proposed. This paper aims to describe a
                        solution ba sed on Hyperledger Aries which is capable to achieve zero-knowledge proof to make an
                        attribute-based authentication and authorization for the web able to cope with the recent legal

                    <p class="abstract_paper">In the Internet of Things (IoT) context, a considerable quantity of data
                        flows from sensors to centralized servers, holding sensitive information related to users.
                        Unfortunately, how servers store these data instances is usually poorly documented and does not
                        offer any transparency to the users but may pave the way to possible privacy violations. Web
                        decentralization is a prominent solution to cope with these issues and legal obligations
                        regarding data protection so that multiple domains are progressively adopting it as the
                        principal technological enabler. The IoT is not among them yet, as a centralized approach is
                        still the most common one; however, moving data location away from servers to prefer gateways or
                        directly to devices closer to users and under their direct control can realize a more
                        decentralized approach and alleviate the issues related to performance, throughput as well as
                        data protection. This paper aims to exploit existing data decentralization solutions, like
                        Social Linked Data (Solid), to define a more distributed data management for IoT and propose a
                        proof-of-concept implementation of a Smart City platform where users can store and directly
                        manage data produced by public or private IoT devices. Despite providing decentralized data
                        handling, Solid is still affected by a centralized identity management and authentication
                        implementation represented by OpenID Connect. Therefore, to fulfill our vision of a
                        decentralized IoT, we also investigate how decentralizing authentication within Solid and a new
                        user-centric approach based on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) represents a promising
                        solution.</p>
