                        Software Defined Networks (SDNs) are establishing the foundation for externally managed network
                        infrastructures. In alignment with SDN principles, Digital Twin Network (DTN) technology offers
                        significant potential to enhance network security accuracy and proactiveness. This paper
                        presents a formal, comprehensive architecture that seamlessly integrates real-time monitoring
                        capabilities, security policy enforcement mechanisms, and predictive analytics within a unified
                        digital twin model. The architecture has been implemented in a smart grid case study, showcasing
                        its usage in environments characterized by proprietary protocols and heterogeneous device
                        ecosystems. The architecture incorporates advanced VLAN segmentation approaches and adaptive
                        firewall policy management while maintaining cross-network visibility. This research establishes
                        a reference for future DTN security applications leveraging SDN environments, offering enhanced
                        visibility, faster incident detection, and more effective threat mitigation strategies for
                        complex network infrastructures.

                    <p class="abstract_paper">The Web of Things (WoT) represents a com- plex ecosystem of interconnected
                        devices that exchange vast amounts of data, enabling advanced applications essential for various
                        industrial and social processes. These applica- tions face stringent security requirements due
                        to the open nature of the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem and the widespread deployment of
                        devices in public environments, posing significant challenges in safeguarding against malicious
                        activities. FIWARE has established itself as a leading IoT infrastructure standard, offering
                        robust security and access control through key components that facilitate authentication, access
                        management, and secure data transmission. However, traditional authentication methods cannot be
                        implemented at end-device level, posing significant risks. This study bridges critical gaps by
                        seamlessly integrating Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) into FIWARE by incorporating an innovative
                        delegate node designed to enhance the computational capabilities of resource-constrained IoT
                        devices while adhering to SSI design principles. By deploying an SSI-compliant agent on a
                        gateway node and utilizing keys stored on devices with minimal memory—requiring only 520 KB of
                        SRAM—via MQTT, this approach demonstrates its feasibility both in terms of performance and
                        security. The results indicate an average session key generation and authentication time of
                        2.573 seconds, enabling mutual authentication between the application and the end device, making
                        it suitable for real- world scenarios. Also, we provide a formal verification for the proposed
                        protocol using the ProVerif model checking tool to check and validate our approach.

                        control are among the key security measures suggested for their protection. However, in the
                        medical context, it is crucial to balance security and privacy support with timeliness and ease
                        of access, which requires innovative solutions.

                        This manuscript introduces an innovative approach leveraging Soulbound Tokens (SBTs) and
                        Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), particularly zk-SNARKs, to provide a privacy-aware mechanism for
                        patient authentication in the medical domain. SBTs are utilized within an Attribute-Based Access
                        Control (ABAC) model, ensuring that only eligible patients can access specific medical
                        treatments. In a treatment-specific model, an SBT is issued for each diagnosis, allowing precise
                        control but increasing management complexity. Alternatively, in a diagnosis-category-based
                        model, SBTs are grouped by diagnostic categories. This reduces the number of tokens and
                        optimizes the space in the patient’s wallet but sacrifices some precision in the information.
                        Results demonstrate the timeliness of the proposed approach, with an average time of 6.82s for
                        the release of an SBT and a maximum on-chain verification time of 15.04ms, showcasing their
                        future adoption in a real-time environment, such as the medical context.

                    <p class="abstract_paper">Internet of Things (IoT) devices are increasingly employed in monitoring
                        and controlling both domestic and industrial infrastructures. However, security measures are
                        often neglected due to the computational resource limitations of these devices. Despite numerous
                        research initiatives aimed at developing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) for IoT, practical
                        implementation-focused studies remain scarce. The goal of this research is to develop an
                        anomaly-based IDS using a supervised approach with three different neural network models:
                        Sequential Neural Network (SNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Deep Recurrent Neural
                        Network (DRNN). The objective is to determine whether it is feasible to create and deploy a
                        high-performing IDS directly on the ESP32 board while simultaneously maintaining low resource
                        requirements. To achieve this, the IDS is first trained and then tested on the NSL-KDD dataset.
                        Results show that the most accurate IDS utilizes the SNN model, achieving a precision level of
                        94.04%. This IDS, when deployed on the ESP32-WROOM-32 microcontroller, reports a minimum
                        inference time of 0.226 ms, an average time of 3.198 ms, and a maximum time of 10.478 ms,
                        requiring just over 8 KB of SRAM for installation.

                        limited capacity that are not easily replaceable or rechargeable, and that constrain
                        significantly the sensing, computing, and communication tasks that devices can perform.
                        The Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) paradigm addresses this
                        issue by delivering power wirelessly to energy-harvesting IoT devices with the same
                        signal used for information transfer. For their peculiarity, these networks require
                        specific energy-efficient planning and management approaches. However, to date, it is
                        not clear what are the most effective strategies for managing a SWIPT network for energy
                        efficiency. In this paper, we address this issue by developing an analytical model based
                        on stochastic geometry, accounting for the statistics of user-perceived performance and
                        base station scheduling. We formulate an optimization problem for deriving the
                        energy-optimal configuration as a function of the main system parameters, and we propose
                        a genetic algorithm approach to solve it. Our results enable a first-order evaluation of
                        the most effective strategies for energy-efficient provisioning of power and
                        communications in a SWIPT network. We show that the service capacity brought about by
                        users brings energy-efficient dynamic network provisioning strategies that radically
                        differ from those of networks with no wireless power transfer.</p>

                    <p class="abstract_paper">Contractual clarity is one of the most critical requirements in drafting a
                        contract, yet its importance is often underestimated. This paper investigates the exploitability
                        of Large
                        Language Models (LLMs) to validate the comprehensiveness and
                        correctness of contractual clauses, addressing the pressing need
                        for precision in contract drafting, and the eventual possibility
                        of getting improvement measures. Specifically, this study utilizes
                        LLMs to automatically analyze and refine contractual clauses, focusing on improving clarity,
                        coherence, and juridical compliance.
                        By assessing the linguistic and structural features of the clauses,
                        the LLM-based approach identifies potential sources of ambiguity
                        and suggests modifications to ensure legal validity and reduce
                        the risk of dispute. The framework’s efficacy is demonstrated
                        through a concrete case study composed of ten contractual clauses
                        that illustrate its impact on enhancing contractual juridical
                        compliance. This work represents a step forward in automating
                        legal validation, offering a practical tool for creating legally
                        robust contracts.

                            autonomous vehicles, healthcare, and smart cities, massive amounts of data are produced at
                            the

                            context
                            can be a huge challenge. Therefore, this paper combines an approach based on Tiny Federated
                            Learning and Transfer Learning with on-board training, as an effective paradigm to
                            continuously
                            analyze data locally without having to transfer sensitive data to untrusted servers and
                            networks. Moreover, a decentralized blockchain-based federated learning framework is
                            implemented
                            to provide tamper-proof data protection and resistance to malicious or compromised tiny

                                the increased need for practical and safe authentication methods. However, one of the

                                challenges in these systems is the lack of a robust mechanism to revoke compromised

                                effectively. The Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), which uses the blockchain-based

                                and revocation, is presented in this article as a novel solution to this critical issue.

                                combining the transparency and immutability of blockchain technology with smart

                                certificates.
                                The
                                conducted study investigates the limitations of existing revocation methods of

                                mechanisms and proposes the EAS as a viable alternative. In the design phase, the paper
                                demonstrates the system's efficiency in handling attestation requests, verifying
                                attestations,
                                and securely managing revocations. EAS excels in providing reliable revocation, thereby

                                the risks associated with compromised hardware-based passwordless systems.

                                automotive industry is steering us towards a more interconnected world. This enhanced
                                interconnectivity fosters a more streamlined driving experience, reduces costs, and
                                provides
                                timely driver assistance. The electric/electronic (EE) architectures of modern vehicles
                                are
                                inherently complex due to the multitude of components they encompass. Contemporary
                                architectures
                                reveal that these components converge at an electronic control unit (ECU) called the
                                central
                                gateway, which could potentially represent a single point of failure. While this central
                                unit is
                                typically adequately safeguarded, the same cannot be said for the connected components,
                                which
                                often remain vulnerable to cyber threats. The ISO/SAE 21434 standard paved the way for
                                automotive cybersecurity and could be used in parallel with other standards such as ISO
                                26262
                                and ISO PAS 21488. Automatic collision notification (ACN) is one of the most typical

                                conducting a comparative analysis of security threats in two distinct ACN architectures.
                                Notably, despite ACN architectures exhibiting inherent similarities, the primary
                                distinction
                                between the two architectures lies in their strategies for crash estimation and
                                detection,
                                followed by subsequent communication with emergency response teams. A rigorous security
                                assessment was conducted using the ISO/SAE 21434 standard, employing the TARA and STRIDE
                                methodologies through the Ansys medini analyze software. This analysis identified an
                                average
                                of

                                Web authentication is primarily based on password usage, representing the
                                weakest link in the entire security chain. The number of services offered over the web
                                is
                                continuously increasing, and with them also the number of required passwords that users

                                to
                                create and securely store. Despite various standards for password-less or multi-factor
                                authentication, another issue is that most web authentication means use an identity
                                provider
                                (or

                                Recently, we are witnessing a radical change of perspective, where identity checks and
                                enforcement are moved away from the providers and more focused on users. Within such
                                user-centric approaches, Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) has faced progressive popularity,
                                and
                                some authentication mechanisms based on SSI have been proposed. This paper aims to

                            <p class="abstract_paper">In the Internet of Things (IoT) context, a considerable quantity
                                of
                                data
                                flows from sensors to centralized servers, holding sensitive information related to
                                users.
                                Unfortunately, how servers store these data instances is usually poorly documented and
                                does
                                not
                                offer any transparency to the users but may pave the way to possible privacy violations.
                                Web
                                decentralization is a prominent solution to cope with these issues and legal obligations
                                regarding data protection so that multiple domains are progressively adopting it as the
                                principal technological enabler. The IoT is not among them yet, as a centralized
                                approach is
                                still the most common one; however, moving data location away from servers to prefer
                                gateways or
                                directly to devices closer to users and under their direct control can realize a more
                                decentralized approach and alleviate the issues related to performance, throughput as
                                well
                                as
                                data protection. This paper aims to exploit existing data decentralization solutions,
                                like
                                Social Linked Data (Solid), to define a more distributed data management for IoT and
                                propose
                                a
                                proof-of-concept implementation of a Smart City platform where users can store and
                                directly
                                manage data produced by public or private IoT devices. Despite providing decentralized
                                data
                                handling, Solid is still affected by a centralized identity management and
                                authentication
                                implementation represented by OpenID Connect. Therefore, to fulfill our vision of a
                                decentralized IoT, we also investigate how decentralizing authentication within Solid
                                and a
                                new
                                user-centric approach based on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) represents a promising
                                solution.</p>
