                    <p class="abstract_paper">As data collection systems become more complex and pervasive, ensuring
                        transparency and accountability in the acquisition and use of personal data becomes increasingly
                        critical. This work investigates the use of knowledge graphs as a solution to this problem,
                        emphasizing their capacity to represent and enforce privacy laws in a decentralized setting.
                        Knowledge graphs provide full privacy management and can be applied also to decentralized
                        systems by providing a consistent representation of data and privacy policies. We specifically
                        discuss how knowledge graphs can be used to track consent management and data retention
                        policies; we also present a case study of our framework in action, demonstrating how it can be
                        used to ensure transparency in an increasingly popular decentralized data collection system. The
                        implementation of such a framework in a decentralized context shows that the use of knowledge
                        graphs can provide a transparent and accountable view of the data collection process, improving
                        trust and confidence in the system among both data subjects and regulators.</p>

                    <h6> 20th International Conference on Security and Cryptography - SECRYPT 2023</h6>
                    <p class="abstract_paper">Web authentication is primarily based on password usage, representing the
                        weakest link in the entire security chain. The number of services offered over the web is
                        continuously increasing, and with them also the number of required passwords that users need to
                        create and securely store. Despite various standards for password-less or multi-factor
                        authentication, another issue is that most web authentication means use an identity provider (or
                        a federation of providers) advocated to create, manage and check digital identity claims; able
                        to profile user habits related to web navigation and violate rights in terms of privacy.
                        Recently, we are witnessing a radical change of perspective, where identity checks and
                        enforcement are moved away from the providers and more focused on users. Within such
                        user-centric approaches, Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) has faced progressive popularity, and
                        some authentication mechanisms based on SSI have been proposed. This paper aims to describe a
                        solution ba sed on Hyperledger Aries which is capable to achieve zero-knowledge proof to make an
                        attribute-based authentication and authorization for the web able to cope with the recent legal
                        obligations in terms of privacy.</p>

                    <h6> Computational Science and Its Applications â€“ ICCSA 2023 Workshops</h6>
                    <p class="abstract_paper">In the Internet of Things (IoT) context, a considerable quantity of data
                        flows from sensors to centralized servers, holding sensitive information related to users.
                        Unfortunately, how servers store these data instances is usually poorly documented and does not
                        offer any transparency to the users but may pave the way to possible privacy violations. Web
                        decentralization is a prominent solution to cope with these issues and legal obligations
                        regarding data protection so that multiple domains are progressively adopting it as the
                        principal technological enabler. The IoT is not among them yet, as a centralized approach is
                        still the most common one; however, moving data location away from servers to prefer gateways or
                        directly to devices closer to users and under their direct control can realize a more
                        decentralized approach and alleviate the issues related to performance, throughput as well as
                        data protection. This paper aims to exploit existing data decentralization solutions, like
                        Social Linked Data (Solid), to define a more distributed data management for IoT and propose a
                        proof-of-concept implementation of a Smart City platform where users can store and directly
                        manage data produced by public or private IoT devices. Despite providing decentralized data
                        handling, Solid is still affected by a centralized identity management and authentication
                        implementation represented by OpenID Connect. Therefore, to fulfill our vision of a
                        decentralized IoT, we also investigate how decentralizing authentication within Solid and a new
                        user-centric approach based on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) represents a promising
                        solution.</p>
