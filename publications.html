                    <p class="abstract_paper">The continuous enhancement and extensive digitalization of medical
                        services have raised various challenges regarding security and privacy. Among these,
                        authentication is one of the most critical, considering identity spoofing and weak passwords.
                        Recently, novel authentication methods such as user-centric authentication are trying to solve
                        the problem by moving identity data and relative claim verification away from a centralized
                        identity manager. When turning this paradigm into the medical domain, it is needed to encompass
                        that not all users are equal, but certain classes are characterized by precise privileges with
                        respect to authentication, such as doctors that must be prioritized over patients. Moreover, it
                        is unfeasible to impose a single technology and infrastructure within an ecosystem characterized
                        by current medical applications; therefore, multiple different solutions need to coexist. In
                        this paper, we discuss a novel framework able to cope with the interoperability, backup and
                        restore of Blockchain-based Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) wallets.
                        We particularly evaluated the system in a medical context by outlining the different roles of
                        holders with related wallet typologies. Our approach demonstrates its feasibility through the
                        use of a shared registry and smart contract that can smoothly work with two kinds of wallet
                        implementation in a federation of issuers and verifiers.</p>

                    <p class="abstract_paper">Smart contracts are self-executing programs that can run on a blockchain.
                        Due to the fact of being immutable after their deployment on blockchain, it is crucial to ensure
                        their correctness. For this reason, various approaches for static analysis of smart contracts
                        have been proposed, but they may be on the one hand imprecise or on the other hand difficult to
                        train. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting smart contract vulnerabilities
                        using OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3) language model. Our approach, called
                        VulntHunt-GPT, uses GPT-3 to examine Ethereum smart contracts in order to identify the most
                        popular vulnerabilities according to OWASP. We train VulntHunt-GPT on a dataset of smart
                        contract functions and vulnerabilities to improve its accuracy. Our experiments show that
                        VulntHunt-GPT outperforms almost all the existing state-of-the-art approaches in detecting a
                        variety of vulnerabilities, including reentrancy attacks, integer overflow, and uninitialized
                        storage. In addition, we conduct a case study to demonstrate the effectiveness of VulntHunt-GPT
                        in detecting real-world smart contract vulnerabilities. We show that VulntHunt-GPT can identify
                        previously unknown vulnerabilities in popular smart contracts, highlighting its potential for
                        improving smart contract security. Our approach provides a promising direction for using natural
                        language processing techniques to improve smart contract security and reduce the risk of smart
                        contract exploits.</p>

                    <p class="abstract_paper">Hardware-based solutions are becoming more and more popular as a result of
                        the increased need for practical and safe authentication methods. However, one of the key
                        challenges in these systems is the lack of a robust mechanism to revoke compromised credentials
                        effectively. The Ethereum Attestation Service (EAS), which uses the blockchain-based Ethereum
                        platform to create a decentralized, tamper-resistant infrastructure for credential attestation
                        and revocation, is presented in this article as a novel solution to this critical issue. By
                        combining the transparency and immutability of blockchain technology with smart contracts and
                        cryptographic techniques, the EAS enables secure and auditable management of certificates. The
                        conducted study investigates the limitations of existing revocation methods of password-less
                        mechanisms and proposes the EAS as a viable alternative. In the design phase, the paper
                        demonstrates the system's efficiency in handling attestation requests, verifying attestations,
                        and securely managing revocations. EAS excels in providing reliable revocation, thereby reducing
                        the risks associated with compromised hardware-based passwordless systems.
                        Moreover, this research explores the benefits of EAS-based revocation within the IoT context,
                        where Physically Unclonable Functions (PUFs) face similar challenges as HSMs. Experimental
                        results, obtained in a testnet environment, reveal reduced authentication times, making this
                        solution suitable for real-time scenarios as well.</p>

                    <p class="abstract_paper">In the context of the widespread adoption of user-centric authentication
                        methods, safeguarding the confidentiality of private keys during the exchange of credentials has
                        become a critical concern. Key Event Receipt Infrastructure (KERI), distinguished by its
                        distinctive design focusing on key events and receipts, aligns seamlessly with the ethos of
                        user-centric authentication, eschewing the necessity for blockchain integration. This research
                        leverages the architectural model of KERI to discern potential implications within the
                        contemporary landscape of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) ecosystems, thereby contributing to the
                        evolution of identity management practices. The need for this research arises from the
                        recognition that while SSI obviates the need for central authorities, thereby augmenting privacy
                        and security, the imperative to preserve and securely store private keys persists. Our primary
                        findings confirm that the integration of KERI within the SSI ecosystem provides a more resilient
                        protocol for authentication by preventing the exchange of any kind of key used for the
                        generation of the proof. This approach aims to prevent attacks in line with the principles of
                        decentralization and trustlessness inherent in blockchain technologies. This research
                        contributes to the expanding body of literature devoted to security and access management within
                        the dynamic realm of user-centric applications and authentication.</p>

                    <h6> IET Cyber-Physical Systems: Theory & Applications</h6>
                    <p class="abstract_paper">The Internet of Things (IoT) is revolutionizing the healthcare industry by
                        enhancing personalized patient care. However, the transmission of sensitive health data in IoT
                        systems presents significant security and privacy challenges, further exacerbated by the
                        difficulty of exploiting traditional protection means due to poor battery equipment and limited
                        storage and computational capabilities of IoT devices. The authors analyze techniques applied in
                        the medical context to encrypt sensible data and deal with the unique challenges of
                        resource-constrained devices. A technique that is facing increasing interest is the Physical
                        Unclonable Function (PUF), where biometrics are implemented on integrated circuits' electric
                        features. PUFs, however, demand special hardware, so in this work, instead of considering the
                        physical device as a source of randomness, an ElectroCardioGram (ECG) can be taken into
                        consideration to make a ‘virtual’ PUF. Such an mechanism leverages individual ECG signals to
                        generate a cryptographic key for encrypting and decrypting data. Due to the poor stability of
                        the ECG signal and the typical noise existing in the measurement process for such a signal,
                        filtering and feature extraction techniques must be adopted. The proposed model considers the
                        adoption of pre-processing techniques in conjunction with a fuzzy extractor to add stability to
                        the signal. Experiments were performed on a dataset containing ECG records gathered over 6
                        months, yielding good results in the short term and valuable outcomes in the long term, paving
                        the way for adaptive PUF techniques in this context.</p>

                        encompassing a vast array of devices and applications, including mission-critical ones, the need
                        for secure and privacy-aware solutions increases. Traditional centralized authentication
                        mechanisms may not be suitable for the highly distributed and heterogeneous nature of IoT
                        environments, and they also have a very high demand in terms of energy and memory, which does
                        not match the availability of resource-constrained devices. In this study, we suggest a novel
                        solution to these difficulties based on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) principles, while taking
                        into account the innovative Web of Things (WoT) architecture.
                        It discusses how these elements from SSI can be applied in a WoT environment to establish trust
                        between devices, users, and applications. Additionally, the paper explores the potential
                        challenges and opportunities of integrating SSI into the WoT ecosystem, such as scalability,

                        capacity that are not easily replaceable or rechargeable, and that constrain significantly the
                        sensing, computing, and communication tasks that they can perform. The Simultaneous Wireless
                        Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) paradigm addresses this issue by delivering power
                        wirelessly to energy-harvesting IoT devices with the same signal used for information transfer.
                        For their peculiarity, these networks require specific energy-efficient planning and management
                        approaches. However, to date, it is not clear what are the most effective strategies for
                        managing a SWIPT network for energy efficiency. In this paper, we address this issue by
                        developing an analytical model based on stochastic geometry, accounting for the statistics of
                        user-perceived performance and base station scheduling. We formulate an optimization problem for
                        deriving the energy optimal configuration as a function of the main system parameters, and we
                        propose a genetic algorithm approach to solve it. Our results enable a first-order evaluation of
                        the most effective strategies for energy-efficient provisioning of power and communications in a
                        SWIPT network. We show that the service capacity brought about by users brings energy-efficient
                        dynamic network provisioning strategies that radically differ from those of networks with no
                        wireless power transfer.</p>

                    <h6> Vehicles 2023</h6>
                    <p class="abstract_paper">The increasing usage of autonomous and automatic systems within the
                        automotive industry is steering us towards a more interconnected world. This enhanced
                        interconnectivity fosters a more streamlined driving experience, reduces costs, and provides
                        timely driver assistance. The electric/electronic (EE) architectures of modern vehicles are
                        inherently complex due to the multitude of components they encompass. Contemporary architectures
                        reveal that these components converge at an electronic control unit (ECU) called the central
                        gateway, which could potentially represent a single point of failure. While this central unit is
                        typically adequately safeguarded, the same cannot be said for the connected components, which
                        often remain vulnerable to cyber threats. The ISO/SAE 21434 standard paved the way for
                        automotive cybersecurity and could be used in parallel with other standards such as ISO 26262
                        and ISO PAS 21488. Automatic collision notification (ACN) is one of the most typical systems in
                        a vehicle, and limited effort has been dedicated to identifying the most suitable architecture
                        for this feature. This paper addresses the existing security and privacy gap of this feature by
                        conducting a comparative analysis of security threats in two distinct ACN architectures.
                        Notably, despite ACN architectures exhibiting inherent similarities, the primary distinction
                        between the two architectures lies in their strategies for crash estimation and detection,
                        followed by subsequent communication with emergency response teams. A rigorous security
                        assessment was conducted using the ISO/SAE 21434 standard, employing the TARA and STRIDE
                        methodologies through the Ansys medini analyze software. This analysis identified an average of
                        310 threats per architecture, including a significant number of high-level threats (11.8% and
                        15%, respectively), highlighting the importance of a comprehensive evaluation.</p>

                        deployable, loosely coupled, and organized around business capabilities. As they are starting to
                        be used in sensitive applications, security has started to be a priority, where authentication
                        is one of the first protection means to be offered to developers by those products supporting
                        microservice development. However, the available authentication solutions in these products are
                        highly centralized, leveraging JSON Web Token (JWT) or related standards. This poses a serious
                        issue in meeting the recent privacy legal obligations.
                        In this paper, we propose a solution for integrating a decentralized blockchain-based
                        authentication solution within the context of Istio, which is a service mesh supporting

                        transparency and accountability in the acquisition and use of personal data becomes increasingly
                        critical. This work investigates the use of knowledge graphs as a solution to this problem,

                        Knowledge graphs provide full privacy management and can be applied also to decentralized
                        systems by providing a consistent representation of data and privacy policies. We specifically

                        Web authentication is primarily based on password usage, representing the
                        weakest link in the entire security chain. The number of services offered over the web is
                        continuously increasing, and with them also the number of required passwords that users need to
                        create and securely store. Despite various standards for password-less or multi-factor
                        authentication, another issue is that most web authentication means use an identity provider (or
                        a federation of providers) advocated to create, manage and check digital identity claims; able
                        to profile user habits related to web navigation and violate rights in terms of privacy.
                        Recently, we are witnessing a radical change of perspective, where identity checks and
                        enforcement are moved away from the providers and more focused on users. Within such
                        user-centric approaches, Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) has faced progressive popularity, and
                        some authentication mechanisms based on SSI have been proposed. This paper aims to describe a

                        flows from sensors to centralized servers, holding sensitive information related to users.
                        Unfortunately, how servers store these data instances is usually poorly documented and does not
                        offer any transparency to the users but may pave the way to possible privacy violations. Web
                        decentralization is a prominent solution to cope with these issues and legal obligations
                        regarding data protection so that multiple domains are progressively adopting it as the
                        principal technological enabler. The IoT is not among them yet, as a centralized approach is
                        still the most common one; however, moving data location away from servers to prefer gateways or
                        directly to devices closer to users and under their direct control can realize a more
                        decentralized approach and alleviate the issues related to performance, throughput as well as
                        data protection. This paper aims to exploit existing data decentralization solutions, like
                        Social Linked Data (Solid), to define a more distributed data management for IoT and propose a
                        proof-of-concept implementation of a Smart City platform where users can store and directly
                        manage data produced by public or private IoT devices. Despite providing decentralized data
                        handling, Solid is still affected by a centralized identity management and authentication
                        implementation represented by OpenID Connect. Therefore, to fulfill our vision of a
                        decentralized IoT, we also investigate how decentralizing authentication within Solid and a new
                        user-centric approach based on Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) represents a promising
                        solution.</p>
