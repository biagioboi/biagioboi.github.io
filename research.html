            <h3>Optimization of energy efficiency in SWIPT-based systems</h3>
            Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer (SWIPT) is a technology that enables the simultaneous
            transmission of data and power over the same wireless medium. The idea is to harvest energy from radio
            frequency (RF) signals while also using those signals for communication. SWIPT is particularly useful in
            scenarios where powering devices with traditional methods (e.g., batteries) is challenging, such as in
            remote or hard-to-access areas.

            In SWIPT systems, a trade-off exists between the amount of power harvested and the quality of data
            transmission, as extracting more energy can reduce the signal strength available for information transfer.
            Techniques like power splitting (allocating part of the signal for energy harvesting and the rest for
            communication) and time switching (alternating between energy harvesting and data reception) are commonly
            used to balance this trade-off.

            My research focuses on techniques aimed at improving SWIPT performance. My <a
                href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TGCN.2025.3552557">first research</a> in this topic
            regards the optimization of base stations (BSs), where results show the importance of both BSs and UEs,
            thanks to their interference contributions. In a <a
                href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/10778375">second
            work</a> I investigated the role of user distribution in a vehicular network, where
            base stations are distributed along roads following a Poisson Line Cox Process and user devices are modeled
            using a Poisson Point Process.

            In the last year I shifted the focus to optimizing the heterogeneous networks, where both mobile
            and IoT devices co-exist. My investigation in this area are mostly related to load shifting, AoI, and beamforming.

            <h3>Decentralized Identity Management</h3>
            In todayâ€™s digital age, where personal data has become a commodity traded by corporations and governments
            alike, the need for a more secure and privacy-preserving identity system has never been more critical.
            Traditional centralized identity systems pose numerous risks, including data breaches, identity theft, and
            mass surveillance. However, emerging technologies offer a promising solution: Decentralized IDentity (DID)
            and Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI).

            My research in this area is focused on implementing decentralized authentication in traditional systems, but
            also in IoT systems, where secure authentication is much more complex due to the possible attacks.
            I'm also evaluating the scalability of these approaches, as well as the security and interoperability
            through framework such as <a href="https://credo.js.org/">Credo.ts</a> and <a
                href="https://keri.one/">KERI</a>.

            <h3>Smart Contract Vulnerability Assessment</h3>
            The programmability of blockchain-based platforms offered by smart contracts has allowed the creation of new
            solutions that have led to the advent of Web 3.0 and decentralized applications. These solutions have
            enabled the design and implementation of new security services, such as Self Sovereignty Identity, for the
            decentralization of digital identity management, and asset tokenization, which means digitizing tangible and
            intangible assets and converting them into tokens, which are then stored on the blockchain.

            Once an asset is tokenized and stored on the blockchain, it becomes secure, immutable and easy to exchange,
            completely or partially. Blockchain-based asset tokenization certainly has many advantages; however, it is
            important to note that tokenization is not without challenges and risks, such as lack of security and
            regulations. These are aspects that are currently being investigated.

            My research is majorly focus on analyzing vulnerabilities over multiple blockchains, such as <b>Ethereum</b>,
            <b>Algorand</b>, <b>Solana</b>, and so on. I'm currently using approaches based on ML, but I'm also
            interested in smart
            contract formal
            verification.
